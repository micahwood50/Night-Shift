# Night Shift

This script is my quick reproduction of the picture from [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/proceduralgeneration/comments/dsa9w9/night_shift/)

We start with seven circles formed as hexagon with each circle having a probability of being split into hexagon of sub-circles

This script requires [Processing](https://www.processing.org) program to run.
